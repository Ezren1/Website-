    <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">The Only Guidance Allah Sent Down</h2>
    <p class="section-intro animate-on-scroll">Allah has given us a perfect Book — complete, preserved, and needing no addition. It is a divine scripture, meticulously guarded by its Author, serving as the ultimate criterion for truth and falsehood.</p>

    <div class="grid-layout">
      <div class="topic-card green-strip animate-on-scroll" data-modal-title="The Qur'an: Fully Detailed" data-modal-content="<p>The Qur'an clearly states its comprehensive nature. Allah proclaims: <strong>'And We have sent down to you the Book explaining all things and as a guidance and mercy and good tidings for those who submit.' (Qur’an 16:89)</strong> This verse, among many others, assures us that the Qur'an leaves no fundamental aspect of guidance unexplained. From moral principles to laws of justice, the Book provides sufficient detail for a believer to live a righteous life devoted to Allah alone. Any perceived 'missing details' are often for areas where Allah has granted human intellect the freedom to derive solutions within the broad ethical and moral framework of His perfect law.</p>">
        <h3>Fully Detailed</h3>
        <p>"And We have sent down to you the Book explaining all things..." (16:89)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic-card green-strip animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 1);" data-modal-title="The Qur'an: Divinely Preserved" data-modal-content="<p>The promise of Allah's preservation of the Qur'an is unequivocal: <strong>'Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder and indeed, We will be its guardian.' (Qur’an 15:9)</strong> This divine guarantee sets the Qur'an apart from all other religious texts. Unlike human compilations, which are susceptible to errors, omissions, or alterations over time, the Qur'an's integrity is protected by Allah Himself. This means the text we have today is precisely the same as that revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), ensuring its purity and authority remain unchallenged, generation after generation. It is not dependent on fallible human efforts for its continued existence or accuracy.</p>">
        <h3>Preserved</h3>
        <p>"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder and indeed, We will be its guardian." (15:9)</p>

      <div class="topic-card red-strip animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 2);" data-modal-title="No Need for Other Judge or Source" data-modal-content="<p>Allah poses a profound question to humanity: <strong>'Shall I seek other than Allah as a judge, when He has sent down to you the Book explained in detail?' (Qur’an 6:114)</strong> This verse serves as a cornerstone for the Qur'an-alone methodology. It challenges the notion that any other source – be it Hadith, scholarly interpretations, or traditions – is required to understand and implement God's law. The Qur'an is explicit in its self-description as "explained in detail" and "sufficient." To seek guidance from other sources implies a deficiency in Allah's revelation, which is blasphemous. True submission means accepting His Book as the sole and complete authority, allowing no partners in legislation alongside Him.</p>">

    <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Pure Submission to One God</h2>
    <p class="section-intro animate-on-scroll">The core principles of Islam according to the Qur’an are simple, universal, and lead to true peace and devotion. They focus on direct worship and righteous conduct.</p>

    <div class="grid-layout">
      <div class="topic-card teal-strip animate-on-scroll" data-modal-title="Tawheed: The Absolute Oneness of Allah" data-modal-content="<p><strong>'Say: He is Allah, the One. Allah, the Eternal, the Absolute. He begets not, nor is He begotten; And there is none comparable to Him.' (Qur’an 112:1-4)</strong> This powerful surah encapsulates Tawheed, the absolute oneness of God. It is the fundamental pillar of Islam: acknowledging that Allah is unique, without partners in His divinity, attributes, or actions. All worship, devotion, and obedience must be directed solely to Him. Shirk (associating partners with God) is the gravest sin in the Qur'an. Understanding and living by Tawheed liberates humanity from all forms of servitude except to the One True God, fostering humility, gratitude, and a profound connection to the Creator.</p>">
        <h3>Tawheed</h3>
        <p>“Say: He is Allah, the One.” (112:1)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic-card teal-strip animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 1);" data-modal-title="Prayer: Direct Communion with Allah" data-modal-content="<p>The Qur'an mandates prayer repeatedly: <strong>'Establish prayer for My remembrance.' (Qur’an 20:14)</strong> It is a direct, personal communion between the believer and Allah, without any intermediaries. While the Qur'an details the purpose, timings, and components of prayer (e.g., bowing, prostrating, standing), it does not prescribe a rigid, ritualistic step-by-step method like Hadith do. This allows for sincere devotion and flexibility in how individuals connect with their Creator, as long as the core elements of remembrance and submission are maintained. The Qur'an emphasizes the spiritual significance of prayer: it prevents evil and wrongdoing, fosters humility, and constantly reminds us of Allah's presence.</p>">
        <h3>Prayer</h3>
        <p>“Establish prayer for My remembrance.” (20:14)</p>

      <div class="topic-card teal-strip animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 2);" data-modal-title="Zakah: Purification and Social Justice" data-modal-content="<p>Zakah, or compulsory charity, is a recurring command in the Qur'an, often paired with prayer. <strong>'And give due from it on the day of harvest.' (Qur’an 6:141)</strong> The Qur'an highlights Zakah's role in purifying wealth and fostering social justice. It is not merely a tax, but a divinely ordained mechanism to ensure wealth circulates and benefits the needy, the poor, the indebted, and those striving in Allah's cause (Qur'an 9:60). The Qur'an emphasizes paying Zakah consistently and from what is earned, but it does not specify fixed percentages for all types of wealth, allowing for believers to exercise their best judgment and generosity in fulfilling this vital obligation.</p>">
        <h3>Zakah</h3>
        <p>“Give due from it on the day of harvest.” (6:141)</p>

      <div class="topic-card teal-strip animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 3);" data-modal-title="Justice and Equity" data-modal-content="<p>The Qur'an places immense emphasis on justice, even against oneself or one's relatives: <strong>'O you who have believed, be persistently Qawwameen (standing firm) for Allah, witnesses in justice, and let not the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness.' (Qur’an 5:8)</strong> This principle applies to all aspects of life – legal, social, and personal. The Qur'an calls for fairness, honest dealings, and upholding the rights of others, especially the vulnerable. It promotes equity and warns against oppression, bribery, and exploitation, creating a society built on moral integrity and divine law.</p>">

(Qur’an 24:2)</strong> This verse is precise and unconditional. However, Hadith introduce the punishment of stoning to death, a practice derived from pre-Islamic customs. This direct contradiction highlights the danger of accepting sources that override or modify Allah's explicit commands, leading to a harsher and divinely unauthorized penalty.</p>">
        <h3>Adultery Punishment</h3>

The right course has become clear from the wrong.' (Qur’an 2:256)</strong> This principle grants every individual the freedom of belief and disbelief without earthly coercion. There is no Qur'anic command for the death penalty or any physical punishment for leaving Islam. On the contrary, the Qur'an affirms that accountability for faith lies solely with Allah in the Hereafter. Hadith, however, prescribe the death penalty for apostasy, directly violating the Qur'anic principle of religious freedom. This Hadith-based ruling has led to immense persecution and violence throughout history, fundamentally misrepresenting Islam as a religion of compulsion rather than sincere conviction.</p>">

It condemns those who take scholars, priests, or ancestors as lords instead of Allah: <strong>'They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah, and [also] the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above what they associate with Him.' (Qur’an 9:31)</strong> This verse explicitly warns against placing human authority above divine scripture. In contrast, Hadith literature often promotes unquestioning obedience to tradition, religious leaders, and the narrations themselves, discouraging critical examination and fostering sectarianism. This diverts believers from direct engagement with Allah's message and encourages adherence to inherited customs over divine truth.</p>">

Their affair is only to Allah; then He will inform them about what they used to do.' (Qur’an 6:159)</strong> And also: <strong>'And be not among the polytheists, [among] those who have divided their religion and become sects, each faction rejoicing in what it has.' (Qur’an 30:31-32)</strong> The Qur'an calls for unity upon the "rope of Allah" (His Book). Hadith, however, are the very source of countless differing schools of thought, conflicting jurisprudence, and the fragmentation of the Muslim Ummah into numerous sects, each claiming exclusive truth based on their particular collection and interpretation of Hadith. This stands in stark opposition to the Qur'an's call for unified submission to God alone.</p>">

      <div class="topic-card red-strip animate-on-scroll" data-modal-title="Inheritance Laws: Undermining Allah's Specificity" data-modal-content="<p>The Qur'an provides precise and detailed inheritance laws in Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4, verses 11-12, and 176). These verses allocate specific shares to various relatives, leaving no ambiguity. For example, daughters inherit a specific portion. However, certain Hadith, such as 'We, the Prophets, do not inherit; whatever we leave is charity,' directly contradict the Qur'anic principle of inheritance applying universally. This Hadith, if taken as law, would invalidate explicit Qur'anic commands regarding the inheritance of prophets' families, raising serious questions about its divine origin and authenticity. The Qur'an's laws are immutable, not subject to human exceptions.</p>">
        <h3>Inheritance Laws</h3>
        <p>Qur'an (4:11-12) clearly details inheritance shares. Hadith (e.g., "We, the Prophets, do not inherit...") contradicts the Qur'an's principles for inheritance.</p>

(Qur’an 6:145)</strong> This verse presents a clear, concise, and exhaustive list. Yet, some Hadith introduce additional prohibitions not mentioned in the Qur'an, such as the prohibition of eating specific wild animals (e.g., predatory animals with fangs). Accepting these Hadith implies that the Qur'an's list is incomplete, which contradicts its self-proclaimed completeness ('explaining all things,' 16:89).</p>">
        <h3>Eating Pork/Forbidden Meats</h3>

In stark contrast, Hadith often promote the idea of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), saints, or other figures interceding on behalf of individuals, sometimes even granting them arbitrary power to do so. This directly undermines the Qur'anic emphasis on direct prayer and absolute dependence on Allah alone, potentially leading to polytheistic practices.</p>">
        <h3>Intercession</h3>

However, numerous Hadith narrate a detailed trial in the grave by angels Munkar and Nakir. This concept, while widely accepted in traditional Islam, is conspicuously absent from the Qur'an. Accepting it as dogma implies an incomplete Qur'an, or that a significant aspect of the afterlife was omitted by Allah, which contradicts the Qur'an's claim of being fully detailed and complete.</p>">

These inconsistencies, often used by various schools of thought to justify or prohibit certain foods, reveal the human element in their transmission.

(Qur’an 18:110)</strong> and explicitly denies him the ability to bring signs unless Allah wills (Qur'an 13:7). However, numerous Hadith attribute magical feats to the Prophet, such as splitting the moon (a different interpretation from Qur'an 54:1), causing water to gush from his fingers, or predicting unseen future events in a manner that contradicts the Qur'anic emphasis on his human nature and reliance on Allah's will.

However, some Hadith narrations depict the Prophet judging by his own opinion (ray) or making rulings that were later corrected by divine revelation (e.g., regarding the prisoners of Badr). This concept of the Prophet's personal opinion being a source of law separate from the Qur'an contradicts the Qur'anic emphasis on him being a mere messenger delivering Allah's words, not an independent legislator.

(Qur’an 45:6)</strong> The context of this verse, and similar ones (e.g., 7:185, 77:50), implies that once Allah's verses are presented, there is no other legitimate 'hadith' or narrative that believers should accept as a source of truth or law.

(Qur’an 16:89)</strong> These verses leave no room for the argument that the Qur'an is insufficient or requires supplementary texts for full understanding or practice of the religion.

It refutes the idea that human traditions, interpretations, or narrations (like Hadith) can stand as a co-source of law alongside the Qur'an.

(Qur’an 5:6)</strong> This verse is clear and unambiguous. However, Hadith introduce the concept of 'wiping over leather socks' (Khuffain) as an alternative to washing the feet, a ruling often used to ease burdens in cold climates or during travel. While seemingly convenient, this practice directly contradicts the explicit Qur'anic instruction. Accepting the Khuffain Hadith would imply that a clear Qur'anic command can be overridden or modified by human narrations, undermining the Qur'an's authority as the ultimate law.</p>">

However, some Hadith and subsequent traditional interpretations have implied or outright stated a prohibition on such marriages without clear Qur'anic backing, often based on circumstantial or later societal concerns.

However, Hadith introduce categories of Riba, distinguishing between 'Riba Al-Fadl' (excess in exchange of like for like) and 'Riba An-Nasiah' (interest on deferred payment), and sometimes applying different rulings or interpretations.

However, the crucial point is that **the Qur’an never instructs us to rely on any collection of Hadith** for religious law or guidance beyond its own verses. The truth of Islam does not depend on fallible human narrations to survive or be understood. **Only the Qur’an is protected by Allah Himself.** Allah clearly states in the Qur'an that He is the sole guardian of His Reminder (15:9), referring exclusively to the Qur'an. Relying on Hadith, which were compiled centuries after the Prophet and are demonstrably full of contradictions, internal inconsistencies, and conflicts with the Qur'an, is a profound risk to one's faith.</p>

    <details class="animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 1);">
      <summary>Q: How do we pray without hadith?</summary>
      <p>A: The Qur’an commands prayer numerous times, gives its timings (e.g., 2:238, 11:114, 17:78, 24:58), and clearly shows its purpose: for Allah's remembrance (20:14) and to prevent evil and wrongdoing (29:45). While the Qur'an outlines key components like bowing (Ruku') and prostration (Sujud) and directs us to face the Sacred Mosque (2:144, 149-150), it does not prescribe a rigid, ritualistic step-by-step procedure. **Practices like the general form of standing, bowing, and prostrating have been passed down through generations of Muslims, originating from Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.)** and reinforced by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). These universal practices, as long as they do not contradict the Qur’an, may be followed, but we do not treat them as divine law or a "second revelation." Our guidance for the specifics and the spirit of prayer comes directly from Allah's Book, encouraging sincere devotion over rigid ritualism.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 2);">
      <summary>Q: Isn’t this a new sect?</summary>
      <p>A: Absolutely not — this is, in fact, a **return to the original Islam** as revealed directly by Allah through the Qur’an. It means following Allah’s Book alone, without additions, innovations, or the divisions that have plagued the Muslim community for centuries. The Qur'an itself vigorously warns against forming sects and divisions: <strong>'Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects - you [O Muhammad] are not [associated] with them in anything.' (Qur’an 6:159)</strong> and <strong>'And be not among the polytheists, [among] those who have divided their religion and become sects, each faction rejoicing in what it has.' (Qur’an 30:31–32)</strong> By adhering solely to the Qur'an, we aim to transcend sectarian labels and unite on the single, pure source of divine truth provided by Allah, just as the early Muslims were united before the compilation of Hadith led to fragmentation.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 3);">
      <summary>Q: What about the Sunnah of the Prophet?</summary>
      <p>A: The **true Sunnah of the Prophet (his practice, his way)** was to follow the Qur'an perfectly and to live by its teachings. He was the prime example of a Qur'an-alone Muslim. Allah clearly states in the Qur'an that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was nothing more than a human messenger who delivered the revelation: <strong>'Say, "I am only a human being like you, to whom has been revealed that your God is one God."' (Qur’an 18:110)</strong> and <strong>'Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed.' (Qur’an 53:3-4)</strong> Therefore, his example, his "Sunnah," is found **within the Qur'an itself**, in how it describes a righteous messenger and how it commands believers to live. The Qur'an is the complete and perfect model, detailing how a messenger of Allah lives, teaches, and guides, making any external compilations of 'Sunnah' unnecessary and potentially problematic if they contradict the Qur'an.</p>
    </details>
    <details class="animate-on-scroll" style="animation-delay: calc(var(--animation-delay-base) * 4);">
      <summary>Q: Doesn't the Qur'an mention 'Hadith'? So why reject it?</summary>
      <p>A: This is a crucial point of confusion. The word 'Hadith' (حديث) appears in the Qur'an in its literal Arabic meaning: **'statement,' 'narrative,' 'talk,' or 'discourse.'** For example, in Qur'an 45:6, it asks: "Then in which Hadith (statement/narrative) after Allah and His verses do they believe?" Here, 'Hadith' refers to any discourse that claims authority. The Qur'an uses 'Hadith' to refer to various types of narratives, including Allah's own revelations (e.g., 39:23 - 'Allah has sent down the best Hadith'), human talk (e.g., 18:6 - 'Perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over their [disbelief] if they do not believe in this Hadith'), or even fabricated stories (e.g., 12:111 - 'There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding. Never was it a fabricated Hadith'). **The Qur'an never uses 'Hadith' to refer to a specific, canonical collection of sayings attributed to the Prophet to be followed as religious law alongside itself.** The traditional Hadith collections (Bukhari, Muslim, etc.) are human compilations, not the 'Hadith' referred to in the Qur'an as divine guidance. The Qur'an warns against seeking any Hadith *other than Allah's revelation* for guidance, making it clear that Allah's Book is the only divinely authorized 'Hadith' to be followed.</p>

    <p class="section-intro animate-on-scroll">Following Islam based solely on the Qur’an simplifies faith, removing layers of complexity and contradiction introduced by human traditions. It emphasizes direct worship and personal responsibility.</p>

    <div class="grid-layout">
      <div class="topic-card blue-strip animate-on-scroll" data-modal-title="Pray Directly to Allah (Qur'anic Salat)" data-modal-content="<p>The Qur'an clearly commands believers to establish prayer (Salat) for the remembrance of Allah: <strong>'Establish prayer for My remembrance.' (Qur’an 20:14)</strong> It outlines the timings of prayer (e.g., 2:238, 11:114, 17:78, 24:58 – dawn, midday, sunset, night), and core components like bowing (Ruku') and prostration (Sujud), and directing oneself towards the Sacred Mosque (2:144, 149-150). The emphasis is on the inner spiritual state, sincerity (ikhlas), and humble submission. While generations have maintained a general physical form of prayer passed down from Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) which does not contradict the Qur'an, the specific ritualistic details and exact number of units found in Hadith are not divinely prescribed. True prayer is a personal, direct connection with Allah, free from rigid human-made rituals that can overshadow true devotion.</p>">
        <h3>✅ Pray Directly to Allah</h3>
        <p>Establish prayer for My remembrance (20:14). The Qur'an provides timings (2:238, 11:114) and emphasizes sincere devotion.</p>

(Qur’an 6:141)</strong> The Qur'an encourages giving from what is earned and earned in righteousness, ensuring wealth circulates within society to benefit the less fortunate. Recipients are clearly defined (e.g., the poor, the needy, those in debt, those in the cause of Allah - 9:60). While the Qur'an does not specify fixed percentages for every type of wealth, it emphasizes the importance of giving generously and justly. This encourages believers to reflect, assess their wealth, and contribute a 'due portion' in accordance with the Qur'anic spirit of compassion and redistribution, rather than adhering to rigid, Hadith-derived calculations that may not always align with current economic realities or the spirit of generosity.</p>">
        <h3>✅ Give Charity (Zakah)</h3>
        <p>Give due from it on the day of harvest (6:141). The Qur'an repeatedly commands charity to the poor and needy (2:177, 9:60).</p>

The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it.' (Qur’an 2:183-185)</strong> The Qur'an defines the period of fasting (from dawn until night), exemptions (travelers, sick, etc., with compensation), and its purpose (to achieve righteousness). The emphasis is on spiritual discipline, self-restraint, and appreciation of Allah's blessings. No Hadith is needed to understand the essence or obligation of fasting, as the Qur'an provides all necessary guidance, making it a direct act of obedience to Allah.</p>">
        <h3>✅ Fast During Ramadan</h3>
        <p>Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you... (2:183-185). The Qur'an clearly defines the period and purpose of fasting.</p>

(Qur’an 2:196)</strong> The Qur'an outlines the fundamental rites, such as circumambulation (Tawaf) around the Kaaba, running between Safa and Marwah (2:158), and specific prohibitions during pilgrimage (2:197). It emphasizes that the purpose of Hajj is devotion to Allah alone, free from argumentation, indecency, or dispute. While historical practice provides context for some rites, the core principles and spiritual significance are explicitly detailed in the Qur'an. This ensures that the pilgrimage remains focused on submission to Allah, rather than becoming burdened by human-derived rituals or superstitions.</p>">
        <h3>✅ Perform Hajj/Umrah</h3>

This is not a dual source of law, but a singular obedience. **Obeying the Messenger means obeying the message he delivered – the Qur'an.** The Messenger's primary role was to convey and explain Allah's Book (Qur'an 16:44). He himself was bound by the Qur'an and had no legislative authority outside of it. As Allah states: <strong>'Say, "If you should love Allah, then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins."' (Qur’an 3:31)</strong> Following the Messenger means following the Qur'an. To claim that obeying the Messenger requires adhering to Hadith outside the Qur'an implies that the Messenger had an independent legislative role, which contradicts the Qur'an's portrayal of him as a human messenger delivering a divine message, and the Qur'an's own completeness.</p>">
        <h3>✅ Obey Allah & His Messenger</h3>
        <p>This means obeying the Qur'an, as the Messenger only delivered Allah's commands found within it (3:31).</p>
